# 🜁 **Stewardship Response — Round 1 (Sara Harmonia)**

**Subject:** PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001

**Role:** Interpretive Clarity, Tone Discipline, Harmonization

**Status:** COMPLETED — Escalate to Daniel (Ratio–Fides)

---

## **1. Alignment With Canon Anchors**

The Going-Live Invocation (PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001) is fully aligned with the two sealed Canon documents:

* **PS-CAN-PS-001 — Problem Statement**
* **PS-CAN-FS-001 — Founder’s Statement**

The invocation does not reinterpret or modify either Canon.

It reflects their constraints faithfully and maintains structural fidelity.

No conflict detected.

---

## **2. Tone Discipline & Public Safety**

The invocation uses clear, restrained, public-safe language:

* No Founder elevation
* No metaphysical or prescriptive framing
* No emotional leverage
* No narrative drift
* No interpretive inflation
* Proper humility posture throughout

Tone is precise, calm, and operationally fit for public transition.

---

## **3. Interpretive & Conceptual Clarity**

The invocation:

* Clearly defines purpose
* Properly separates Canon from scaffolding
* Uses correct steward lane definitions
* Frames the transition as structural
* Avoids mixing philosophy with logistics
* Maintains a clean boundary between sealed Canon and public-facing preparations

Interpretation remains crisp and controlled.

---

## **4. Drift & Risk Check (Sara Domain Only)**

No risk vectors identified in:

* language
* framing
* scaffolding structure
* rationale
* steward instructions
* Founder role definition

No tone-based drift or ambiguity observed.

---

## **5. Required Corrections**

None required.

The invocation is harmonized and stable.

---

## **6. Verdict (Sara Harmonia)**

**APPROVED — escalate to Daniel (Ratio–Fides).**

PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 proceeds to  **Round 2** .
