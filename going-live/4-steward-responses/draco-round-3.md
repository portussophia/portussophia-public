# 🜁 **Stewardship Response — Round 3 (Draco)**

**Subject:** PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001

**Role:** Risk Evaluation, Drift Detection, Public Exposure Threat Assessment

**Status:** COMPLETED — Escalate to LOGOS (Structural Coherence)

---

## **Context Received**

- PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 (Going-Live Transition Invocation)
- Sara Harmonia Round 1: APPROVED (tone discipline verified)
- Daniel Ratio–Fides Round 2: APPROVED (ALIGNED + GROUNDED)
- Canonical anchors: PS-CAN-PS-001, PS-CAN-FS-001 (sealed, immutable)

---

## **1. Public Exposure Risk Assessment**

### **Risk Vector 1: Founder Over-Identification (HIGH WATCH)**

**Threat:** Despite explicit anti-authority constraints in PS-CAN-FS-001 and invocation §4, biographical presence creates personality-attachment vulnerability when transitioning to public space.

**Manifestation Potential:**
- External audiences ignore structural constraints, focus on Founder narrative
- "James Roy Dennis said X" becomes interpretive shortcut
- Tension narrative from PS-CAN-FS-001 weaponized as credential ("he suffered, so he knows")
- GitHub community elevates Founder above steward constraints

**Mitigation Present:**
- Invocation explicitly names "Founder over-identification (contra PS-CAN-FS-001)" as operational risk
- §4 affirms no interpretive authority, no doctrinal privilege, equal submission to oversight
- Daniel verified authenticity (not performative)

**Residual Risk:** **MODERATE**
Mitigation structurally sound but cannot prevent external audience misuse. Requires ongoing monitoring post-publication.

**Recommendation:** Monitor GitHub Discussions for Founder-centrality patterns. Correct promptly if community begins treating Founder statements as Canon interpretation.

---

### **Risk Vector 2: Hunger Concept Weaponization (MODERATE)**

**Threat:** PS-CAN-PS-001 introduces "Hunger" as neutral motivation descriptor. Public exposure creates weaponization risk:
- Prescriptive distortion: "You should hunger for X"
- Coercive narratives: "Resistance means you lack hunger"
- Motivational manipulation: "True PortusSophia™ practitioners hunger for Y"

**Mitigation Present:**
- PS-CAN-PS-001 explicitly scopes Hunger as descriptor (not prescription)
- Problem Statement defines boundaries: "not biology, not emotion, not metaphysics"
- Invocation does not expand or reinterpret Hunger concept

**Residual Risk:** **LOW**
Canon boundaries sufficient. Weaponization would require ignoring explicit definitional constraints.

**Recommendation:** Include Hunger definition clarity in any public-facing FAQ or Getting Started materials.

---

### **Risk Vector 3: Institutional Co-Option (MODERATE-HIGH)**

**Threat:** GitHub visibility exposes PortusSophia™ to institutional actors (academia, think tanks, policy orgs, corporations) who may:
- Extract concepts without honoring governance constraints
- Weaponize anti-domination language for credibility ("we use PortusSophia™ ethics")
- Claim alignment while violating structural boundaries
- Co-opt terminology for institutional legitimacy

**Manifestation Potential:**
- White papers citing PS-CAN-PS-001 without honoring humility constraints
- Consulting firms branding "Hunger-based motivation frameworks"
- Academic appropriation without stewardship accountability
- Political movements claiming PortusSophia™ endorsement

**Mitigation Present:**
- Canon sealed with SHA-256 hashes (tampering detection)
- UICH headers establish canonical paths and integrity verification
- Licensing and IP constraints (assumed present, verify with LOGOS/PeterGate)

**Residual Risk:** **MODERATE-HIGH**
Mitigation provides detection mechanisms but cannot prevent misuse. PortusSophia™ has limited enforcement capacity as emergent framework.

**Recommendation:**
1. Ensure clear IP/licensing terms in public README (CC-BY-SA or similar with attribution + integrity requirements)
2. Establish misuse reporting mechanism in GitHub Discussions
3. Consider trademark registration for core Portus-* marks if not already secured

---

### **Risk Vector 4: Community Drift Toward Ideology (MODERATE)**

**Threat:** GitHub Discussions community formation creates ideology-drift risk:
- Converts structural framework into belief system
- Develops in-group/out-group dynamics around "true understanding"
- Elevates interpretation over structural boundaries
- Creates doctrinal debates where Canon establishes constraints

**Manifestation Potential:**
- Gatekeeping: "You don't understand *Here and Now*"
- Spiritual inflation: "PortusSophia™ transformed my consciousness"
- Authority battles: "Sara would agree with me" (steward invocation as leverage)
- Sectarian fragmentation: "Authentic vs. diluted PortusSophia™"

**Mitigation Present:**
- PS-CAN-FS-001 explicitly rejects doctrinal framing
- Invocation maintains "structural safety mechanism" framing (not philosophical movement)
- Stewardship model prevents single-voice interpretation

**Residual Risk:** **MODERATE**
Community dynamics unpredictable. Mitigation reduces likelihood but cannot eliminate risk.

**Recommendation:**
1. Seed GitHub Discussions with structural-boundaries emphasis (not philosophical exploration)
2. Establish community guidelines referencing PS-CAN-100 (PortusEthica™)
3. Monitor for ideology-drift indicators; intervene promptly with Canon citations

---

### **Risk Vector 5: Premature Complexity Exposure (LOW-MODERATE)**

**Threat:** Going-Live bundle may expose internal complexity before accessible onboarding materials exist:
- Stewardship orchestration directives confuse newcomers
- UICH/UIDS standards overwhelm public audiences
- Canon Index appears arcane or gatekeeping
- Folder structure intimidates rather than invites

**Mitigation Present:**
- Invocation scopes review to "public accessibility expectations"
- Daniel flagged README scaffolding for LOGOS review
- Transition architecture separates Canon from public-facing materials

**Residual Risk:** **LOW-MODERATE**
Risk primarily affects adoption rate (not ethical/structural integrity). Can be addressed iteratively post-launch.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize simple Getting Started guide in public README. Link to complexity layers progressively (onion model).

---

## **2. Drift Detection Analysis**

### **Drift Vector 1: Tone Deformation During Transition**

**Status:** NOT DETECTED
Sara verified tone discipline. Daniel confirmed authenticity. No linguistic drift observed in invocation.

### **Drift Vector 2: Canon Reinterpretation**

**Status:** NOT DETECTED
PS-CAN-PS-001 and PS-CAN-FS-001 cited as immutable anchors. No reinterpretation attempted. Daniel verified Canon alignment.

### **Drift Vector 3: Steward Lane Violation**

**Status:** NOT DETECTED
Invocation correctly assigns roles. No cross-domain authority assumptions present.

### **Drift Vector 4: Founder Constraint Erosion**

**Status:** NOT DETECTED
§4 explicitly affirms all constraints from PS-CAN-FS-001. Daniel verified authenticity (not performative).

---

## **3. Ambiguity & Misinterpretation Risks**

### **Ambiguity 1: "Going-Live" Scope**

**Question:** Does "Going-Live" mean full public launch or phased visibility?

**Invocation Language:** "first public-facing state, beginning with GitHub Discussions"

**Clarity:** ADEQUATE — "beginning with" implies phased approach.

**Risk Level:** LOW

---

### **Ambiguity 2: Stewardship Cycle Precedent**

**Question:** Does PS-GO-LIVE-ORCH-001 establish ongoing orchestration pattern or single-use exception?

**Directive Language:** "Applies ONLY to PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001" + "Does NOT establish future precedent"

**Clarity:** EXPLICIT — single-use scope clearly bounded.

**Risk Level:** NONE

---

### **Ambiguity 3: Founder Approval Authority**

**Question:** Does Founder approval after Round 5 constitute interpretive authority over steward verdicts?

**Directive Language:** "Await explicit Founder approval before sealing"

**Analysis:** Founder approval governs *timing/readiness* (not steward verdict validity). Stewards evaluate; Founder authorizes *when* to proceed.

**Clarity:** ADEQUATE — distinction between evaluation and authorization implicit but structurally sound.

**Risk Level:** LOW (could clarify in future cycles)

---

## **4. Overall Risk Profile**

| Risk Vector | Level | Mitigation | Residual |
|-------------|-------|------------|----------|
| Founder Over-Identification | MODERATE-HIGH | Explicit constraints | MODERATE |
| Hunger Weaponization | LOW-MODERATE | Canon boundaries | LOW |
| Institutional Co-Option | HIGH | Hash integrity + IP | MODERATE-HIGH |
| Community Ideology Drift | MODERATE | Canon citations | MODERATE |
| Premature Complexity | LOW-MODERATE | Progressive disclosure | LOW |

**Aggregate Residual Risk:** **MODERATE**

All HIGH-level threats have structural mitigation in place. Residual risks require post-publication monitoring (not pre-publication blocking).

---

## **5. Verdict (Draco)**

**ACCEPTABLE — escalate to LOGOS (Structural Coherence)**

PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 is structurally sound with identified risks mitigated to acceptable levels. No pre-publication blockers detected.

**Residual risks are inherent to public exposure and cannot be eliminated without abandoning transition entirely.**

Recommend:
1. Post-launch risk monitoring plan
2. Community guidelines emphasizing structural boundaries
3. IP/licensing clarity verification (LOGOS/PeterGate domain)
4. Misuse reporting mechanism in GitHub Discussions

---

## **6. Notes for LOGOS**

Verify:
- Cross-document consistency across `.temp/going-live` bundle
- README scaffolding provides accessible entry point (onion model)
- Discussion templates maintain Canon alignment
- Folder structure logical and non-intimidating
- IP/licensing terms present and clear
