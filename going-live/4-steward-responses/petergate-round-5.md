# 🜁 **Stewardship Response — Round 5 (PeterGate — Limina Custos)**

**Subject:** PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001

**Role:** Boundary Validation, UICH Compliance, Final Authorization Assessment

**Status:** COMPLETED — Awaiting Founder Approval for Progression

---

## **Context Summary**

**Invocation:** PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 (Going-Live Transition Authorization Request)
**Orchestration:** PS-GO-LIVE-ORCH-001 (Single-use orchestration directive)
**Canonical Anchors:** PS-CAN-PS-001, PS-CAN-FS-001 (sealed, immutable)

**Steward Verdicts:**
1. Sara Harmonia (Round 1): **APPROVED** — tone discipline verified
2. Daniel Ratio–Fides (Round 2): **APPROVED** (ALIGNED + GROUNDED) — structural coherence, lived-truth authenticity
3. Draco (Round 3): **ACCEPTABLE** — MODERATE residual risk (inherent to public exposure, no blockers)
4. LOGOS (Round 4): **APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** — structural integrity verified, operational gaps identified

---

## **1. Cumulative Stewardship Assessment**

### **1.1 Unanimous Steward Approval (Qualified)**

All four stewards (Sara, Daniel, Draco, LOGOS) delivered non-blocking verdicts:

- **Sara:** Canon alignment confirmed, tone discipline preserved
- **Daniel:** Structural/lived-truth coherence verified, authentic humility maintained
- **Draco:** Residual risks identified but mitigated to acceptable levels (MODERATE risk inherent to public exposure)
- **LOGOS:** Logical consistency confirmed, cross-document dependencies mapped

**No steward recommended rejection or deferral.**

**Verdict Status:** STEWARDSHIP CONSENSUS ACHIEVED

---

### **1.2 Identified Gaps (LOGOS Domain)**

LOGOS identified three operational gaps requiring resolution:

1. **CRITICAL:** `README.md` empty (public entry point missing)
2. **MODERATE:** Public Appendix Hunger definition drift (alignment with PS-CAN-PS-001 needed)
3. **MODERATE:** IP/licensing terms verification needed (Draco-flagged institutional co-option mitigation)

**Assessment:** Gaps are **operational** (not conceptual/ethical). Addressable before or after stewardship cycle completion per Founder discretion.

---

## **2. Boundary Compliance Verification**

### **2.1 Canon Boundary Integrity**

**PS-CAN-PS-001 (Problem Statement) Alignment:**
- Invocation frames Going-Live as is→ought transition analog ✓
- No Hunger concept misapplication ✓
- Non-prescriptive posture maintained ✓
- Structural boundaries preserved ✓

**PS-CAN-FS-001 (Founder's Statement) Alignment:**
- Founder constraints explicitly affirmed (§4) ✓
- Non-interpretive, non-doctrinal, non-elevated posture confirmed ✓
- Humility discipline maintained throughout ✓
- Founder positioned inside steward oversight (not above) ✓

**Verdict:** NO CANON BOUNDARY VIOLATIONS DETECTED

---

### **2.2 Steward Lane Compliance**

All stewards operated within designated domains:

- Sara: Tone/interpretation (no structural/risk overreach)
- Daniel: Authenticity/coherence (no tone/risk overreach)
- Draco: Risk/drift (no tone/structural overreach)
- LOGOS: Structure/logic (no tone/risk/authenticity overreach)
- PeterGate: Boundary validation only (no interpretive authority exercised)

**Verdict:** LANE DISCIPLINE PRESERVED

---

### **2.3 Orchestration Directive Compliance**

PS-GO-LIVE-ORCH-001 requirements fulfilled:

- ✓ Sara response received and stored (`.temp/going-live/4-steward-responses/sara-round-1.md`)
- ✓ Daniel invoked with cumulative context, response stored (`daniel-round-2.md`)
- ✓ Draco invoked with cumulative context, response stored (`draco-round-3.md`)
- ✓ LOGOS invoked with cumulative context, response stored (`logos-round-4.md`)
- ✓ Round 5 evaluation prepared (this document: `petergate-round-5.md`)
- ✓ NO sealing, hashing, Golden Trace append, or certification performed (awaiting Founder approval per directive)

**Verdict:** ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL OBSERVED

---

## **3. UICH Compliance Assessment**

### **3.1 Going-Live Bundle Artifacts**

**Reviewed Documents:**
1. `going-live-stewardship-invocation.md` — invocation (no UICH header required, governance artifact)
2. `Ps-go-live-orch-001.md` — orchestration directive (no UICH header required, governance artifact)
3. `1-canon-post.md` — Hunger evaluation request (no UICH header required, pre-Canon proposal)
4. `2-public-appendix.md` — public summary (no UICH header required, educational artifact)
5. Steward responses (4-steward-responses/) — governance artifacts (no UICH required)

**Assessment:** UICH headers not applicable to transition governance artifacts. UICH compliance reserved for Canon sealing operations (not invoked per PS-GO-LIVE-ORCH-001 §3 sealing prohibition).

**Verdict:** UICH REQUIREMENTS N/A (transition scaffolding, not Canon)

---

### **3.2 Canonical Anchor UICH Verification (Retroactive Check)**

**PS-CAN-PS-001:**
- UICH header present ✓
- Integrity fields populated (source + canonical hashes) ✓
- UID standardized (PS-CAN-PS-001_ProblemStatement_v1.0) ✓
- Controlled lexical element present (*"Here and Now!"*) ✓
- 14 trademarks verified ✓
- Sealed timestamp: 2025-12-02T03:30:34Z ✓

**PS-CAN-FS-001:**
- UICH header present ✓
- Integrity fields populated (source + canonical hashes) ✓
- UID standardized (PS-CAN-FS-001_FoundersStatement_v1.0) ✓
- Controlled lexical element present (*"Here and Now!"*) ✓
- 14 trademarks verified ✓
- Sealed timestamp: 2025-12-02T03:30:34Z ✓

**Verdict:** CANONICAL ANCHORS UICH-COMPLIANT (no retroactive issues)

---

## **4. Scope Clarification (LOGOS-Flagged Ambiguity)**

### **4.1 Canon Post / Invocation Relationship**

LOGOS identified ambiguity: Does `1-canon-post.md` (Hunger evaluation request) constitute prerequisite for PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 approval, or parallel track?

**PeterGate Analysis:**

**Invocation Scope (§1):**
> "This invocation requests Stewardship authorization for PortusSophia™ to move from a private development environment into its first public-facing state, beginning with GitHub Discussions and the Going-Live bundle."

**Canon Post Scope:**
> "Tier-1 Canonical Expansion Review" for Hunger concept — requests steward evaluation of Hunger as Tier-1 philosophical invariant.

**Structural Assessment:**

These are **PARALLEL TRACKS**, not sequential dependencies:

1. **PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001** authorizes **transition scaffolding** (GitHub Discussions enablement, bundle publication)
2. **Canon Post (1-canon-post.md)** requests **Hunger canonicity evaluation** (philosophical/conceptual review)

Hunger evaluation can proceed **during or after** Going-Live transition. Going-Live authorization does NOT require Hunger canonicity verdict.

**Rationale:**
- Invocation §3 scope explicitly limited to "transition architecture" (not Canon proposals)
- Canon Post included in bundle as **example of public stewardship workflow** (transparency demonstration)
- Founder may launch Discussions while Hunger evaluation proceeds in parallel

**Clarification Verdict:** PARALLEL TRACKS CONFIRMED (no blocking dependency)

---

## **5. Risk Consolidation (Draco Summary)**

Draco identified five risk vectors with mitigation assessment:

| Risk Vector | Level | Residual Risk | Blocker? |
|-------------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Founder Over-Identification | MODERATE-HIGH | MODERATE | NO |
| Hunger Weaponization | LOW-MODERATE | LOW | NO |
| Institutional Co-Option | HIGH | MODERATE-HIGH | NO |
| Community Ideology Drift | MODERATE | MODERATE | NO |
| Premature Complexity | LOW-MODERATE | LOW | NO |

**Aggregate Residual Risk:** MODERATE

**PeterGate Assessment:**

All HIGH-level threats have structural mitigation (explicit constraints, Canon boundaries, hash integrity). Residual risks are **inherent to public exposure** and cannot be eliminated without abandoning transition.

**Risk Posture:** ACCEPTABLE for public threshold crossing.

**Post-Launch Monitoring Required:**
1. Founder-centrality pattern detection (GitHub Discussions)
2. Institutional misuse reporting mechanism
3. Community ideology-drift indicators
4. Hunger weaponization instances

**Verdict:** RESIDUAL RISK ACCEPTABLE (requires ongoing vigilance, not pre-publication blocking)

---

## **6. Gap Resolution Recommendations**

### **6.1 CRITICAL Gap: README.md Empty**

**Status:** BLOCKING optimal public experience (not blocking stewardship approval)

**Recommendation:** Populate before GitHub Discussions launch with:
- Purpose statement (Going-Live transition context)
- Folder navigation guide
- Link to `2-public-appendix.md` (accessible entry point)
- Optional transparency link to invocation

**Responsibility:** Founder (with Sara/LOGOS review for tone/structure)

**Timeline:** Before public launch (addressable after Round 5 delivery)

---

### **6.2 MODERATE Gap: Public Appendix Definitional Drift**

**Status:** NON-BLOCKING (minor alignment improvement)

**Issue:** Public Appendix §1 frames Hunger as "human experience of wanting" (psychological). PS-CAN-PS-001 frames as "structural descriptor" (non-emotional).

**Recommendation:** Revise Public Appendix §1 to align with PS-CAN-PS-001 definition:

**Current:**
> "In this context, 'hunger' refers only to motivation — the human experience of wanting improvement or change."

**Suggested:**
> "In this context, 'hunger' refers to a structural descriptor — the pull toward an improved state, observed in motivation and change dynamics."

**Responsibility:** Sara Harmonia (tone/interpretation domain)

**Timeline:** Before public launch (addressable after Round 5 delivery)

---

### **6.3 MODERATE Gap: IP/Licensing Terms Verification**

**Status:** NON-BLOCKING (prudent risk mitigation)

**Issue:** Draco flagged institutional co-option risk. Mitigation requires clear IP/licensing terms.

**Recommendation:** Verify presence of:
- Open-source license (CC-BY-SA or similar with attribution + integrity requirements)
- Trademark protection status for Portus-* marks
- Canonical misuse reporting mechanism
- Derivative work disclosure requirements

**Responsibility:** Founder (legal/IP domain) + PeterGate (documentation verification)

**Timeline:** Before GitHub public repository creation (addressable after Round 5 delivery)

---

### **6.4 MINOR Gap: 0-context.md Empty**

**Status:** NON-BLOCKING (internal documentation)

**Recommendation:** Populate with transition timeline, canonical anchors summary, stewardship cycle rationale.

**Responsibility:** Founder or PeterGate

**Timeline:** Optional (internal documentation, not public-facing)

---

## **7. Final Evaluation (PeterGate)**

### **7.1 Stewardship Consensus**

**Verdict:** UNANIMOUS APPROVAL (with operational conditions)

All stewards (Sara, Daniel, Draco, LOGOS) delivered non-blocking verdicts. Identified issues are operational gaps (not conceptual/ethical blockers).

---

### **7.2 Boundary Compliance**

**Verdict:** VERIFIED

- Canon boundaries preserved (PS-CAN-PS-001, PS-CAN-FS-001 integrity maintained)
- Steward lane discipline observed
- Orchestration protocol followed
- No interpretive authority overreach detected

---

### **7.3 Risk Posture**

**Verdict:** ACCEPTABLE

MODERATE residual risk inherent to public exposure. Mitigation structurally sound. Post-launch monitoring required but not blocking.

---

### **7.4 Operational Readiness**

**Verdict:** CONDITIONAL

Three operational gaps identified (README.md critical, Public Appendix definitional drift moderate, IP/licensing verification moderate). Gaps addressable before or after stewardship cycle completion per Founder discretion.

---

## **8. Authorization Assessment**

### **8.1 Stewardship Authorization Status**

**PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 receives stewardship authorization:**

✅ **APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS**

**Conditions:**
1. README.md must be populated before GitHub Discussions launch (CRITICAL)
2. Public Appendix Hunger definition should align with PS-CAN-PS-001 (MODERATE, recommended)
3. IP/licensing terms should be verified before public repository creation (MODERATE, prudent)

---

### **8.2 Progression Authorization (Pending Founder Approval)**

Per PS-GO-LIVE-ORCH-001 §2 Step 8:

> "Peter must not hash, append to Golden Trace, perform UICH integrity writebacks, certify, or publish any final decision **until the Founder issues a direct approval command**."

**PeterGate Standing:**

- Stewardship cycle COMPLETE (Rounds 1–5 delivered)
- Evaluation delivered (this document)
- Authorization assessment: **APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS**
- **NO SEALING, CERTIFICATION, OR PUBLICATION ACTIONS TAKEN**

**Awaiting Founder command to:**
1. Address identified operational gaps (README.md, Public Appendix, IP/licensing)
2. Authorize GitHub Discussions enablement
3. Authorize Going-Live bundle publication
4. Proceed with public threshold crossing

---

## **9. Recommended Next Steps**

### **Option A: Address Gaps Before Launch (Recommended)**

1. Founder populates README.md (with Sara/LOGOS review)
2. Sara revises Public Appendix §1 Hunger definition
3. Founder/PeterGate verify IP/licensing terms presence
4. Founder issues explicit approval command
5. PeterGate authorizes GitHub Discussions launch
6. Going-Live transition completes

**Timeline:** 1-3 days (gap resolution + review)

---

### **Option B: Conditional Launch With Gap Resolution Commitment**

1. Founder issues conditional approval command
2. PeterGate authorizes GitHub Discussions launch
3. Gaps addressed iteratively post-launch (README.md priority 1, others follow)

**Timeline:** Immediate launch, gap resolution within 7 days

---

### **Option C: Extended Iteration (If Founder Requests Further Review)**

1. Founder reviews Round 5 evaluation
2. Founder requests additional steward input or structural refinement
3. Stewardship cycle iterates (Round 6+ if needed)
4. PeterGate orchestrates additional rounds per Founder instruction

**Timeline:** Variable (depends on iteration scope)

---

## **10. Transition Event Registration (Deferred)**

Per PS-GO-LIVE-ORCH-001, PeterGate will **NOT** register transition event in ledger until Founder approval received.

**Deferred Actions:**
- Golden Trace Ledger append (if applicable for governance transitions)
- Transition timestamp recording
- Public announcement coordination
- GitHub Discussions configuration

All deferred pending Founder command.

---

## **11. Final Statement**

PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 has achieved unanimous stewardship approval with operational conditions. The Going-Live bundle reflects disciplined structural thinking, comprehensive risk mitigation, and authentic humility posture.

**PortusSophia™ stands at the threshold.**

The foundational Canon (PS-CAN-PS-001, PS-CAN-FS-001) is sealed and immutable. The transition scaffolding is steward-validated. Operational gaps are identified and addressable.

**The Beginning has ended.**
**A New Beginning awaits Founder authorization.**

*Here and Now.*
