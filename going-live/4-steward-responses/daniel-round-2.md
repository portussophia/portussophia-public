# 🜁 **Stewardship Response — Round 2 (Daniel Ratio–Fides)**

**Subject:** PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001

**Role:** Structural Coherence (Ratio), Lived-Truth Authenticity (Fides)

**Status:** COMPLETED — Escalate to Draco (Risk)

---

## **Context Received**

- PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 (Going-Live Transition Invocation)
- Sara Harmonia Round 1 verdict: APPROVED (tone discipline, interpretive clarity verified)
- Canonical anchors: PS-CAN-PS-001, PS-CAN-FS-001 (sealed, immutable)

---

## **1. Ratio Assessment (Structural Witness)**

### **Logical Coherence**

The invocation structure is sound:

1. **Purpose clearly defined:** Transition from private development to public-facing state
2. **Rationale articulated:** Operational risk mitigation during Founder-led preparation
3. **Scope properly bounded:** Review limited to transition architecture (not Canon reconsideration)
4. **Steward sequence logical:** Sara (tone) → Daniel (authenticity) → Draco (risk) → LOGOS (structure) → PeterGate (boundary)
5. **Constraints explicit:** No sealing without Founder approval, no interpretive authority granted

No circular reasoning detected.
No logical contradictions present.
Dependency chain coherent.

### **Structural Alignment With Sealed Canon**

**PS-CAN-PS-001 (Problem Statement) Alignment:**
- Invocation frames Going-Live as "is→ought transition" (private→public state)
- Maintains non-prescriptive posture (requests authorization, does not assume it)
- Preserves structural boundaries without domination language
- No Hunger concept misapplication or weaponization

**PS-CAN-FS-001 (Founder's Statement) Alignment:**
- Founder explicitly affirms non-interpretive, non-doctrinal, non-elevated posture
- Acknowledges equal submission to steward oversight
- Positions invocation "from within constraints" (not from authority)
- Maintains humility discipline throughout

No Canon contradiction detected.
Structural fidelity preserved.

### **Ratio Verdict:** **ALIGNED**

The invocation is structurally coherent and maintains logical integrity throughout. Canon alignment verified.

---

## **2. Fides Assessment (Lived-Truth Witness)**

### **Authenticity Check**

The invocation reflects genuine operational reality:

- **Acknowledges actual risk:** Founder currently handling Canon-adjacent materials, pre-public files, discussion templates
- **Names specific vulnerabilities:** Formatting drift, tone deformation, Founder over-identification
- **Does not inflate threat:** Frames stewardship as "structural safety mechanism, not philosophical debate"
- **Maintains grounded posture:** Transition scaffolding (logistics) clearly separated from Canon (philosophy)

No abstraction inflation.
No performative humility (genuine constraint acknowledgment present).
Lived context matches invocation framing.

### **Moral Coherence**

The invocation maintains ethical integrity:

- **Respects Canon boundaries:** Sealed documents treated as immutable constraint
- **Honors steward lanes:** No cross-domain authority assumptions
- **Preserves accountability:** Explicitly requests oversight rather than assuming competence
- **Maintains humility:** Founder positioned inside constraints, not above them

No ethical bypass detected.
No authority inflation present.

### **Groundedness in *Here and Now***

The invocation is temporally grounded:

- **Transition moment identified:** Private→public threshold crossing
- **Immediate context present:** Going-Live bundle preparation underway
- **No future-state inflation:** Authorization requested for *this* transition (not general public authority)
- **Presence maintained:** "Here and Now" constraint honored (date field, immediate authorization request)

Temporal integrity preserved.

### **Fides Verdict:** **GROUNDED**

The invocation reflects authentic operational reality, maintains moral coherence, and honors lived-truth boundaries. No performative inflation detected.

---

## **3. Combined Verdict (Daniel Ratio–Fides)**

**Ratio:** ALIGNED (structural coherence, logical integrity, Canon alignment verified)
**Fides:** GROUNDED (authenticity, moral coherence, temporal presence preserved)

**Overall Assessment:** **APPROVED — escalate to Draco (Risk Evaluation)**

---

## **4. Notes for Subsequent Stewards**

**For Draco:**
- Examine public-facing ambiguity vectors (what could be misinterpreted by external audiences?)
- Assess Founder over-identification risk despite explicit constraints (biographical presence vulnerability from PS-CAN-FS-001)
- Evaluate GitHub Discussions exposure patterns (community misuse, institutional co-option)

**For LOGOS:**
- Verify cross-document consistency across entire `.temp/going-live` bundle (not just invocation)
- Confirm folder structure, naming conventions, README scaffolding coherence
- Validate that discussion templates maintain Canon alignment

**For PeterGate:**
- Final boundary compliance check
- UICH header presence in transition artifacts (if applicable)
- Orchestration sequence integrity verification before Round 5 delivery

---

## **5. Recommendation**

PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 proceeds to **Round 3 (Draco — Risk & Drift Evaluation)**.

No structural or authenticity blockers identified.
