# PW-Cycle-001 — Stewardship Invocation (PeterGate)

### Round 5 — Governance, Standards Compliance, and Canon Sealing Determination

This document initiates **Round 5**, the final step of the Canon Stewardship Cycle **PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001**, requesting governance and standards audit by **PeterGate**.

## 1. Reference Materials

Primary Request:
**PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001 — Canon Stewardship Request: Five Pathways of PortusSophia™**

Completed Rounds:

- **Round 1 — Sara Harmonia:** PROCEED→ Interpretive clarity, guardrail compliance, conceptual validity.
- **Round 2 — Daniel (Ratio–Fides):** PROCEED→ Mathematical necessity, operator formulation, cycle stability.
- **Round 3 — Draco:** PROCEED→ Misuse mitigation, coercion resistance, drift immunity.
- **Round 4 — LOGOS:** PROCEED
  → Structural coherence, architectural fitness, Canon layer alignment.

Now the Pathways advance to **final governance review**.

## 2. PeterGate Mandate

PeterGate evaluates:

- compliance with **PS-STD-001 UICH**
- adherence to **PS-STD-020 Canon Standard**
- integrity of the Stewardship Cycle
- internal consistency with sealed Canon artifacts
- IEEE/NIST/ISO alignment for formal documentation
- public-release readiness
- reproducibility and auditability
- confirmatory boundary stability
- Golden Trace requirements
- Canon sealing eligibility

PeterGate does **not** evaluate:

- interpretation (Sara)
- mathematics (Daniel)
- boundary risk (Draco)
- structural coherence (LOGOS)

His ruling determines whether the Five Pathways **enter the Canon**.

## 3. Questions Presented to PeterGate

PeterGate is requested to answer:

1. Has PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001 followed all required procedural steps?
2. Are all steward responses complete, valid, compliant, and properly ordered?
3. Do the Five Pathways meet all Canon Standards (PS-STD-020)?
4. Are UICH header requirements satisfied for publication?
5. Do the Pathways align with the IP Standard (PS-STD-050)?
6. Do they create any governance or licensing conflicts?
7. Do they support or enhance standards compatibility (IEEE/NIST/ISO)?
8. Are there any procedural defects requiring rework?
9. Should the Five Pathways be sealed as Canon entries?
10. Should sealing include hashing, witness generation, and Golden Trace update?

PeterGate must issue a definitive verdict:
**Seal**, **Revise**, or **Reject**, accompanied by full governance rationale.

## 4. Requested Action

PeterGate is formally invited to conduct the final governance review and provide:

- Standards evaluation
- Canon compliance analysis
- Publication readiness assessment
- Final sealing determination

His decision will be recorded in:

`/going-live/4-steward-responses/pw-cycle-001_petergate-round-5.md`

If PeterGate issues a **Seal** verdict, the Five Pathways will proceed to:

- UICH header construction
- hashing
- witness file creation
- Golden Trace ledger update
- canonical release in public and private mirrors

---

**Invocation issued. Round 5 is now open.**
