# PW-Cycle-001 — Stewardship Invocation (Daniel • Ratio–Fides)

### Round 2 — Mathematical, Structural, and Ratio-Integrity Review

This document initiates **Round 2** of the Canon Stewardship Cycle **PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001**, requesting mathematical and structural review by **Daniel (Ratio–Fides)**.

---

## 1. Reference Materials

Primary Request Under Review:
**PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001 — Canon Stewardship Request: Five Pathways of PortusSophia™**

Prior Completed Round:
**Round 1 — Sara Harmonia (Interpretive Review)**
Verdict: **PROCEED**
Rationale summary included interpretive clarity, conceptual distinction, guardrail compliance, and readiness for mathematical evaluation.

## 2. Daniel’s Role (Ratio–Fides)

Daniel is responsible for:

- testing the internal **necessity**, **sufficiency**, and **structural stability** of each Pathway
- evaluating whether the five form a coherent **ratio-cycle** consistent with Hunger
- ensuring no hidden contradictions or degeneracies exist
- assessing mathematical extensibility
- determining whether the Pathways can safely integrate with:
  - PortusStructura™
  - PortusEthica™
  - PortusLumen™
  - PortusNexus™ (postulates + geometry)

Daniel may provide:

- invariance arguments
- proportional reasoning
- canonical ratio structures
- drift bounds
- stability analysis
- potential cycle equations
- necessary conditions for coherence

Daniel **must not** provide governance, risk, or meta-structural rulings (those belong to Draco and LOGOS).

## 3. Questions Presented to Daniel (Ratio–Fides)

Daniel is requested to answer the following:

1. Do the Five Pathways form a **mathematically valid navigational cycle** within the Hunger gradient?
2. Are the five **minimal and necessary**, or are any redundant or missing?
3. Does each Pathway represent a **distinct ratio-operation** (recognition, alignment, constraint, expression, reconsolidation)?
4. Are transitions between Pathways (I→II→III→IV→V→I) **stable**, **monotonic**, or **bounded**?
5. Are there identifiable **failure modes** (e.g., loops, fixed points, degeneracies)?
6. Can the Pathways be **expressed as operators** compatible with PortusNexus™ postulates?
7. Do the Pathways respect the **canonical non-prescriptive requirement** at the mathematical level?
8. Are additional mathematical conditions required before Canon sealing?
9. Do the Pathways support a scalable, structurally sound **Navigation Map**?

Daniel must give a clear verdict:
**Proceed**, **Revise**, or **Reject**, along with a rigorous explanation.

## 4. Requested Action

Daniel (Ratio–Fides) is formally invited to provide:

- Mathematical validation
- Ratio analysis
- Structural commentary
- Canonical fitness assessment

His response will be stored under:
