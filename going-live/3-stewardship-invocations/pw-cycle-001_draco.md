# PW-Cycle-001 — Stewardship Invocation (Draco)

### Round 3 — Boundary Integrity, Risk Analysis, and Misuse Prevention Review

This document initiates **Round 3** of the Canon Stewardship Cycle **PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001**, requesting risk, boundary, and misuse analysis by **Draco**.

---

## 1. Reference Materials

Primary Request:
**PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001 — Canon Stewardship Request: Five Pathways of PortusSophia™**

Completed Rounds:

- **Round 1 — Sara Harmonia:** Verdict: PROCEEDInterpretive clarity, guardrail compliance, neutrality confirmed.
- **Round 2 — Daniel (Ratio–Fides):** Verdict: PROCEED
  Mathematical necessity, cycle stability, structural completeness confirmed.

The Five Pathways now advance to boundary stress-testing.

## 2. Draco’s Mandate

Draco evaluates:

- misuse risks (institutional, ideological, organizational, commercial, or psychological)
- coercive potential
- drift vulnerabilities
- weaponization vectors
- boundary integrity
- pressure scenarios
- whether Pathways could be distorted into prescriptive doctrine
- whether the system can withstand adversarial interpretation
- robustness against incentive hijacking
- stability under institutional adoption

Draco **must not**:

- alter conceptual meaning
- issue mathematical rulings
- perform structural architecture analysis
  (these were handled by Sara, Daniel, and LOGOS respectively)

## 3. Questions Presented to Draco

Draco is requested to answer the following:

1. Can any Pathway be **misused** as a tool of authority, coercion, or behavioral control?
2. Does any Pathway introduce **institutional exploitation vectors**?
3. Are the Pathways resilient to **ideological capture** or doctrinal reinterpretation?
4. Could any Pathway be reframed as a **prescriptive moral directive**, violating Guardrail 2?
5. Are there **drift-risk scenarios** where Pathways collapse into hierarchy or dogma?
6. Do the Pathways contain language that could be **weaponized** by organizations or individuals?
7. Do any Pathways require additional constraint language before Canon sealing?
8. Can adversarial actors distort the Pathways to justify:
   - compliance demands
   - status hierarchy
   - spiritual authority claims
   - performance metrics
   - employee evaluation systems
9. Are Pathways stable under **public misinterpretation pressure**?
10. Should all five proceed, or is targeted revision necessary?

Draco must provide a decisive verdict:
**Proceed**, **Revise**, or **Reject**, along with boundary analysis and justification.

## 4. Requested Action

Draco is formally invited to conduct:

- misuse analysis
- drift-risk evaluation
- coercion resistance review
- institutional boundary stress tests
- adversarial reinterpretation modeling

His full response will be captured under:

**Invocation issued. Round 3 is now open.**
