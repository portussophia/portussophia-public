# PW-Cycle-001 — Stewardship Invocation (Sara Harmonia)

### Tier-1 Canon Review — Five Pathways of PortusSophia™

This document initiates **Round 1** of the Canon Stewardship Cycle **PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001**, requesting interpretive review by **Sara Harmonia**.

## 1. Reference Document

The Canon Stewardship Request under review is:

**PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001 — Canon Stewardship Request: Five Pathways of PortusSophia™**

This request seeks Tier-1 Canonical validation of five candidate entries:

- PS-CAN-PW-001 — Pathway of Orientation™
- PS-CAN-PW-002 — Pathway of Coherence™
- PS-CAN-PW-003 — Pathway of Ethical Restraint™
- PS-CAN-PW-004 — Pathway of Generative Choice™
- PS-CAN-PW-005 — Pathway of Integration™

## 2. Steward Role: Sara Harmonia

Sara’s responsibilities in Tier-1 review include:

- assessing interpretive clarity, neutrality, and conceptual coherence
- identifying ambiguity or potential drift
- verifying alignment with all Seven Guardrails
- ensuring non-prescriptive, non-metaphysical framing
- confirming that terms and relations are clear for public communication
- checking continuity with Hunger and existing Canon
- determining whether the Pathways constitute a valid conceptual extension

Sara’s analysis **must not** include:

- mathematical validation
- risk modeling
- structural integrity assessment
- governance evaluation

(these belong to Daniel, Draco, LOGOS, and PeterGate respectively)

## 3. Questions Presented to Sara

Sara Harmonia is requested to answer the following:

1. Are the Five Pathways conceptually distinct, and does each avoid domain overlap?
2. Do they arise logically and naturally from the Hunger invariant?
3. Are they fully compliant with the Seven Guardrails?
4. Is the non-prescriptive, non-metaphysical framing intact?
5. Are the definitions interpretively clear enough for Canon use?
6. Do they avoid doctrinal, ideological, or moral assertion?
7. Are they suitable as public-facing conceptual primitives?
8. Does the set of five form a coherent whole rather than a fragmented list?
9. Should they be reviewed as a single conceptual unit, or should some be separated?

Sara must supply:

- a clear verdict (“Proceed”, “Revise”, or “Reject”), and
- a rationale supporting that verdict.

## 4. Requested Action

Sara Harmonia is formally invited to begin **Round 1** of the Canon Stewardship Cycle and provide her Tier-1 interpretive evaluation of the Five Pathways.

Upon completion, her response will be recorded under:

`/going-live/4-steward-responses/pw-cycle-001_sara-round-1.md`
