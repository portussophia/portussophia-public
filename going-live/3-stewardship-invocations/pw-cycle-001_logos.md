# PW-Cycle-001 — Stewardship Invocation (LOGOS)

### Round 4 — Structural Integrity, Architectural Coherence, and Canon Fitness Audit

This document initiates **Round 4** of the Canon Stewardship Cycle **PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001**, requesting structural review and systemwide architectural analysis by **LOGOS**.

---

## 1. Reference Materials

Primary Request:
**PS-CAN-PW-Cycle-001 — Canon Stewardship Request: Five Pathways of PortusSophia™**

Completed Rounds:

- **Round 1 — Sara Harmonia:** PROCEED
- **Round 2 — Daniel (Ratio–Fides):** PROCEED
- **Round 3 — Draco:** PROCEED

LOGOS now receives a structurally stable and risk-cleared conceptual set for architectural audit.

---

## 2. LOGOS Mandate

LOGOS is responsible for:

- analyzing the **system architecture** of the Five Pathways
- checking **internal and external dependencies**
- validating **non-circular conceptual layering**
- assessing alignment with:
  - PortusStructura™
  - PortusEthica™
  - PortusLumen™
  - PortusNexus™
- verifying the **Completeness Condition**
- ensuring no violation of foundational Postulates
- confirming the Pathways do not conflict with existing Canon invariants
- detecting structural drift risk
- confirming the Pathways support future scalability and Maps

LOGOS does **not** evaluate:

- mathematical constraints (Daniel)
- misuse or drift pressure (Draco)
- governance compliance (PeterGate)

LOGOS’ purpose is to answer the question:

> “Does this concept fit flawlessly into the architecture?”

---

## 3. Questions Presented to LOGOS

LOGOS is requested to answer:

1. Do the Five Pathways form a **coherent canonical subsystem**?
2. Do the Pathways conflict with any existing Canon invariants or Standards?
3. Are the Pathways properly positioned in the architecture between Hunger and the Guardrails?
4. Do the Pathways introduce **hidden circular dependencies**?
5. Are all relations between the Pathways strictly **acyclic and stable**?
6. Do the Pathways adhere to the **layering rules** of PortusStructura™?
7. Do the Pathways strengthen or weaken **PortusEthica™ boundaries**?
8. Are the Pathways compatible with **PortusLumen™ illumination functions**?
9. Do they integrate cleanly with PortusNexus™ (postulates, geometry, cycles)?
10. Do the Pathways support long-term Canon scalability and extension?

LOGOS must deliver a clear verdict:
**Proceed**, **Revise**, or **Reject**, with a complete structural rationale.

---

## 4. Requested Action

LOGOS is formally invited to perform the full architectural coherence audit and structural dependency analysis for the Five Pathways.

His response will be stored under:

`/going-live/4-steward-responses/pw-cycle-001_logos-round-4.md`

**Invocation issued. Round 4 is now open.**
