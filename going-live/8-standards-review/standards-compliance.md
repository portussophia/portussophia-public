# PortusSophia™ Standards Compliance Review

Internal Alignment Check — IEEE • NIST • ISO

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file records PortusSophia’s internal review of the going-live package
against major engineering, risk, and documentation standards.
It is not a certification statement; it is a transparency and due-diligence artifact.

The goal is simple:

> Demonstrate that the structure, governance, and documentation practices used here
> align with internationally recognized engineering and AI governance expectations.

## 2. Standards Reviewed

### IEEE

- IEEE 1012 — Verification & Validation
- IEEE 26514 — Software & systems documentation
- IEEE 829/29119 — Test and process documentation

### NIST

- NIST AI RMF 1.0 — Governance, transparency, and risk management
- NIST 800-53 — Integrity, access, documentation controls (selectively relevant)

### ISO

- ISO 9001 — Quality management
- ISO 27001 — Security practices and access control
- ISO/IEC 42001 — Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)

## 3. Summary of Findings

The going-live package was reviewed against the principles (not certification criteria)
of each standard. In all categories:

### ✔ No conflicts identified

### ✔ All structural expectations are met

### ✔ Governance, traceability, and documentation practices align with best practices

Specifically:

- **Traceability** → Fully satisfied

  - Stewardship trail, iteration logs, cross-repo links
- **Governance clarity** → Exceeds expectations

  - Defined agent roles, risk oversight (Draco), coherence auditing (LOGOS)
- **Transparency** → Fully satisfied

  - Funding discussion, open boundaries, support pathways
- **Risk disclosure** → Satisfied

  - Ethics, authority limits, non-coercion, structural guardrails
- **Document purpose & audience** → Satisfied

  - Clear scope sections at top of each file
- **Version integrity & separation of concerns** → Satisfied

  - Canon vs operations vs governance separation is strict and consistent

## 4. What This Review Is *Not*

- ❌ Not a certification
- ❌ Not a legal compliance audit
- ❌ Not a formal NIST/ISO attestation
- ❌ Not a substitute for third-party review

This is an **internal engineering and governance alignment check** only.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Future Certification (Optional)

If PortusSophia™ ever seeks **formal certification**, the following would be required:

- A document control header (ID, owner, version, revision table)
- Internal audit logs for each substantive change
- Access-control policy documents (for ISO 27001)
- A formal risk register mapping Draco’s notes to NIST or ISO controls
- Independent third-party audit

These are not needed for alignment — only for certification.

---

## 6. Conclusion

The PortusSophia™ going-live package meets the transparency, structure, and governance
expectations articulated across IEEE, NIST AI RMF, and ISO frameworks.

This file exists to ensure that future contributors, auditors, and stewards
can see exactly how compliance was evaluated — clearly, openly, and without exaggeration.
