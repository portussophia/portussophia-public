# 🜁 **STEWARDSHIP INVOCATION — GOING-LIVE TRANSITION**

**Status:** Authorized by Founder — Active Stewardship Request

**UID:** PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001

**Classification:** Transition Invocation — Public Release Preparation

**Founder Authorization:** *James Roy Dennis (Founder)*

---

## **0. Canonical Anchors (Sealed, Immutable)**

The Going-Live Transition is governed and bounded by the following sealed Canon documents:

### **PS-CAN-PS-001 — PortusSophia™ Problem Statement**

Defines the structural “is→ought” transition failure observed in human systems and frames **Hunger** as a neutral motivational descriptor. Establishes the philosophical and structural context for all PortusSophia™ transitions.

### **PS-CAN-FS-001 — PortusSophia™ Founder’s Statement**

Provides the human origin context, tension-development arc, humility posture, and non-authority boundaries governing the Founder’s role in all future Canon and public transitions.

These documents are  **not subject to further review** .

They serve as **context and constraint** for this stewardship action.

---

## **1. Purpose of This Invocation**

This invocation requests Stewardship authorization for PortusSophia™ to move from a **private development environment** into its first  **public-facing state** , beginning with GitHub Discussions and the Going-Live bundle.

The purpose is to ensure that:

* Ethical posture is preserved
* Tone and framing are public-safe
* Structural scaffolding is coherent
* No drift was introduced during preparation
* All public elements properly align with sealed Canon

This invocation **does not** propose new Canon content.

It governs the **transition scaffolding** required to go public.

---

## **2. Rationale for Stewardship Review**

Because the Founder is currently handling:

* Canon-adjacent materials
* Pre-public files
* Discussion templates
* Folder scaffolding
* README documents
* Funding placeholders

…there exists operational risk of:

* Unintentional content alteration
* Formatting drift during copy/paste
* Tone deformation
* Cross-structure misalignment
* Ambiguity in public contexts
* Founder over-identification (contra PS-CAN-FS-001)

PortusSophia™ requires **multi-lens Stewardship** for any transition that exposes internal structures to the public.

Stewardship here is a  **structural safety mechanism** , not a philosophical debate.

---

## **3. Scope of Review**

Stewards are asked to evaluate **only** the Going-Live transition architecture, including:

### **A. Structural Review**

* Folder structure under `.temp\going-live`
* Discussion placeholders (including Funding Discussion)
* README scaffolding and cross-links
* Ordering, naming, and clarity
* Alignment with public accessibility expectations

### **B. Tone & Ethical Review**

* Humility, respect, clarity
* No Founder elevation
* Public-safe communication boundaries
* Compliance with PortusEthica™

### **C. Risk Review (Draco Domain)**

* Drift vectors
* Misinterpretation risks
* Public-facing ambiguity
* Institution misalignment

### **D. Canon Alignment Review (LOGOS + Sara)**

Verify that all Going-Live materials:

* Align with PS-CAN-PS-001 (Problem Statement)
* Honor PS-CAN-FS-001 (Founder’s Statement)
* Maintain consistency without reinterpreting sealed Canon

This review does **not** reconsider the sealed Canon.

It ensures the transition does not contradict it.

---

## **4. Founder’s Position and Constraints**

The Founder acknowledges and affirms:

* No interpretive authority over Canon
* No doctrinal privilege
* No elevated epistemic status
* No ability to redefine meaning outside Stewardship
* Full accountability to tone, ethics, and humility boundaries
* Equal submission to Steward oversight

This invocation is made  **from within those constraints** .

---

## **5. Required Stewards (Sequential Order)**

1. **Sara Harmonia**

   Interpretation, tone discipline, clarity, harmonization.
2. **Daniel (Ratio–Fides)**

   Authenticity, experiential grounding, moral coherence.
3. **Draco**

   Risk, drift, ambiguity, public exposure threats.
4. **LOGOS**

   Structural coherence, logical integrity, cross-document alignment.
5. **PeterGate (Limina Custos)**

   Boundary validation, UICH compliance, and final authorization or conditional return.

No steward may operate outside their lane.

---

## **6. Questions for Stewards**

1. Does the Going-Live package align with the sealed Canon (PS-CAN-PS-001 and PS-CAN-FS-001)?
2. Is public-facing tone correctly constrained and safe?
3. Are the structural scaffolds consistent and non-interpretive?
4. Are there detectable drift vectors or risks?
5. Does the Founder’s posture remain within canonical constraints?
6. Is anything ambiguous, unsafe, or requiring refinement?
7. Should any component be deferred or reordered prior to release?

---

## **7. Request to PeterGate**

Upon receiving sequential steward responses, PeterGate is asked to:

* Validate structural and boundary compliance
* Confirm alignment with sealed Canon
* Approve or return the Going-Live package
* Register the transition event in the appropriate ledger
* Authorize progression to the GitHub Publication Phase

This invocation  **does not authorize public release** .

It authorizes  **pre-publication Stewardship Review** .
