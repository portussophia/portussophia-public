# 🜁 Stewardship Orchestration Directive — PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001

**UID:** PS-GO-LIVE-ORCH-001

**Status:** Authorized by Founder — *Single Invocation Scope Only*

**Founder Authorization:** *James Roy Dennis*

**Applies To:** **PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001** *(Going-Live Stewardship Cycle)*

**Does NOT Establish Future Precedent**

---

## **1. Purpose of This Directive**

This directive authorizes **PeterGate (Limina Custos)** to act as **orchestrator** for the *current* Going-Live Stewardship Cycle, PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001. Peter is empowered to:

1. Receive each steward’s sequential response
2. Store the response in the correct directory within the going-live bundle
3. Maintain the continuity and integrity of the stewardship cycle
4. Invoke the next steward in the sequence
5. Deliver a Round 5 evaluation when all prior rounds are complete

This applies **only** to this cycle and does **not** modify how future stewardship cycles operate.

**Critical Instruction:** *PeterGate is explicitly prohibited from sealing, finalizing, or certifying PS-GO-LIVE-INV-001 until the Founder provides direct approval.*

This process may require **multiple iterations** and  **Founder review between rounds** .

---
