# Funding Discussion — Narrative Capsule

PortusSophia™ Going-Live Bundle

This document provides the narrative background for how PortusSophia™ has been sustained so far and why a transparent, optional support pathway is part of the going-live plan. It pairs directly with the `README.md` in this folder and should be read as a companion piece — not a standalone funding mechanism.

## 1. The Reality Behind the Work

PortusSophia™ was not built in a well-funded laboratory or corporate setting.It grew out of:

- A $250 development machine upgraded through literal plasma donations
- Personal credit — primarily Cammie’s — to cover AI tools and GitHub infrastructure
- Long hours of unpaid development, writing, and restructuring
- A commitment to governance-first design under extremely limited resources

This story is shared not to dramatize the hardship, but to **tell the truth** about how much real effort and sacrifice went into getting here.

## 2. Why Talk About Funding Now?

With PortusSophia™ preparing for public visibility, sustainability becomes a real, practical concern.There are costs that never go away:

- Hardware lifecycle and upgrades
- Cloud and domain services
- GitHub organization and tooling
- AI compute for testing, research, and development
- Time itself — writing, reviewing, auditing, stabilizing

Being transparent about these factors honors the structure and ethics of the project.

## 3. Optional Support Pathway

For those who *genuinely want* to help stabilize early development or offset the personal cost already carried, an optional support link is available:

#### 👉 **GoFundMe — Here and Now: A 35-Year Love Story**

[https://www.gofundme.com/f/here-and-now-a-35year-love-story]()

This link exists for one reason only:
**Some people will want to help if they understand the reality behind the work.**

Support is:

- Optional
- Appreciated
- Never tied to authority or influence
- Never a requirement for participation

PortusEthica™ remains fully binding.

---

## 4. Guardrails and Responsibilities

Support does **not** grant:

- Interpretive authority
- Elevated status
- Influence over Canon
- Privileged access of any kind

All funding activity must remain:

- Transparent
- Ethical
- Optional
- Publicly visible
- Non-coercive

This is not an investment vehicle and offers no expectation of return.

---

## 5. What Happens Next

Upon public launch:

- The GoFundMe link may be referenced in GitHub Discussions
- Sustainability strategies can evolve with proper stewardship
- Any formal investment pathways (if ever pursued) will involve legal counsel

For now, this file simply records the **reality** and makes the support path visible for those who seek it.

## 6. Final Note

If PortusSophia™ has meaning to you and you choose to support it — thank you.
If you simply read, reflect, and move on — thank you as well.

Both responses honor the spirit of the work.
