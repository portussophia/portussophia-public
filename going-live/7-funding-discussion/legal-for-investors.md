# **7. Support Pathways (Optional)**

Individuals who wish to materially support the continuation of work may do so  **voluntarily** .

The primary support pathway is:

> **GoFundMe — PortusSophia™ Research & Standards Initiative**
>
> [Fundraiser by James Dennis : Here and Now! — The Love Story](https://www.gofundme.com/f/here-and-now-a-35year-love-story)

**Important:**

Contributions through this pathway:

* are not tax-deductible (PortusSophia™ is not a nonprofit)
* do not establish donor–recipient contracts
* are not payments for access to Canon
* do not offer privileges or interpretive authority
* cannot be exchanged for services

They are  **gifts of support** , nothing more.

A formal **Stewardship Cycle on Funding** will occur after Go-Live, addressing:

* ethical funding boundaries
* philanthropic partnerships
* grant interfaces
* sponsorship neutrality

This ensures that all future investor or supporter interactions remain:
