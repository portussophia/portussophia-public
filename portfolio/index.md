# Architecture Portfolio

A curated set of architectural designs demonstrating my approach to high-stakes systems.

## 1. CoSymmetric Quantum-Aligned Architecture (CQAA)
**Problem:** Layer collisions in complex systems
**Solution:** Symmetry constraints + boundary modeling
**Outcome:** Reduced drift, improved coherence

## 2. Architectural Symmetry Standard (ASS)
**Problem:** Asymmetric governance
**Solution:** Reciprocal evaluability
**Outcome:** Fairness + transparency

## 3. Multi-Site Ecosystem Architecture
Audience-aligned structure preventing drift and confusion.

## 4. WebKernel Architecture
Clear boundary between Canon, Interpretive Layer, and Public content.

## 5. Governance & Stewardship Tools
Role separation, witness cycles, drift scanning, audit protocols.

## 6. Drift & Boundary Engineering
Frameworks for stabilizing fragile, overloaded, or ambiguous systems.
