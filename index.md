# PortusSophia™ Public — Rebuild in the Here and Now

This site is the **public entry point** to the PortusSophia™ project.

PortusSophia™ is a **Negentropic Unit** — a way of turning collapse, suffering, and systemic failure into structure, clarity, and disciplined rebuilding.

There are three ways to enter the story:

---

## 1. Faith-Based Narrative

If you want the story as **testimony** — survival, grace, and “Here and Now!” — start here:

👉 [Faith-Based Story](./faith)

---

## 2. Harmony Narrative

If you’re drawn to the **human arc** — COVID, near-death, 35-year love letters, and rebuilding at 54 — start here:

👉 [Harmony Story](./harmony)

---

## 3. Technical Narrative

If you’re an **architect, engineer, or systems thinker** and want to understand the structural model behind PortusSophia™ — the Negentropic Unit, the Folded Risk Principle, and the Boundary/MVM — start here:

👉 [Technical Story](./technical)
