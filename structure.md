# Structure Overview

This page explains how PortusSophia™ is organized across multiple layers and nodes.

---

## Architectural Layers

### Canon Layer

**Purpose:** Immutable philosophical content
**Access:** Main site (portussophia.com)
**Content:**
- Trilingual philosophical works (English, Latin, Greek)
- Sealed canonical artifacts
- Core philosophical postulates

**Status:** Protected (read-only except through governance workflows)

---

### WebKernel Layer

**Purpose:** Interpretive and explanatory content
**Access:** Main site + public node
**Content:**
- Narrative explanations
- Interpretive essays
- Public-facing overviews
- This orientation layer

**Status:** Mutable (can be revised with appropriate stewardship)

---

### Governance Layer

**Purpose:** Structural enforcement and integrity verification
**Access:** Internal (governance/ directory in main repo)
**Content:**
- Witness cycles (LOGOS structural, DRACO risk)
- Integrity seals and hashes
- Golden Trace ledger
- Stewardship records

**Status:** Auditable but not publicly navigable

---

### Academic Layer

**Purpose:** Research artifacts and formal methods
**Access:** [MIT node](https://mit.portussophia.com)
**Content:**
- Governance architecture documentation
- Witness cycle methodologies
- Integrity ledger examples
- Postulates and formal constraints

**Status:** Public, research-focused

---

## Node Topology

### portussophia.com (Main Site)

**Audience:** General + philosophical + institutional
**Content:** Canon + WebKernel narratives
**Tone:** Philosophical, luminous, governed

---

### mit.portussophia.com (Research Node)

**Audience:** Academic + institutional review
**Content:** Architecture, methods, integrity ledger
**Tone:** Formal, research-focused, zero narrative

---

### public.portussophia.com (Orientation Node)

**Audience:** External, first-time visitors
**Content:** High-level overview, orientation, announcements
**Tone:** Accessible, non-technical, bounded

---

## Steward Roles

### Sara Harmonia (Interpretive Steward)

**Scope:** Language, tone, philosophical coherence
**Boundaries:** Cannot alter sealed canon, cannot override witness determinations

---

### LOGOS (Structural Steward)

**Scope:** Verify architectural postulate compliance
**Boundaries:** Cannot make risk assessments, cannot alter content

---

### DRACO (Risk Steward)

**Scope:** Monitor for delusion, ego inflation, drift
**Boundaries:** Cannot make structural determinations, cannot pathologize vulnerability

---

### PeterGate (Governance Steward)

**Scope:** File operations, integrity sealing, ledger management
**Boundaries:** Cannot compose canonical prose, cannot interpret content

---

### Daniel (Ratio–Fides Witness)

**Scope:** Third-party validation (logical + ethical)
**Boundaries:** Advisory only, cannot seal artifacts

---

## Boundary Principles

### Separation of Concerns

Each layer has **distinct content rules**:

- Canon: Protected, immutable (except via governance)
- WebKernel: Interpretive, revisable
- Governance: Auditable, integrity-sealed
- Academic: Research-focused, formal
- Public: Orientation only, non-canonical

**Violation:** Mixing layers (e.g., publishing governance artifacts on public node) triggers boundary alert.

---

### Upward/Downward Navigation

**Allowed:**
- Canon → WebKernel (interpretation of canonical content)
- WebKernel → Public (orientation summaries)
- Governance → Academic (integrity ledger examples)

**Prohibited:**
- Public → Canon (no direct access to immutable content)
- Public → Governance (no navigation to witness cycles)
- Academic → Private narrative (boundary separation)

---

### Content Classification

| Layer      | Classification         | Mutability | Public Access |
|------------|------------------------|------------|---------------|
| Canon      | Protected              | Immutable  | Via main site |
| WebKernel  | Interpretive           | Mutable    | Yes           |
| Governance | Auditable              | Sealed     | Read-only     |
| Academic   | Research               | Versioned  | Yes           |
| Public     | Orientation            | Mutable    | Yes           |
