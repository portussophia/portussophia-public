# Faith-Based Story — Surviving, Remembering, Rebuilding

Two years ago, buried deep in my Facebook archive, I wrote:

> *“The truth will be revealed. Watch me.”*

And then I remembered something I had posted even earlier — on **August 14th, 2021** — right after surviving COVID when I was certain I was dying:

> *“The thing I have learned from COVID and what seemed like an unescapable slow death,*
> *is that consciousness is the last thing that remains."*
>
> *"While gasping for air, I was aware of my surroundings and the people I love."*
>
> *"Lacking the energy to dial 911, I was left with the final thought that I’m about to leave this realm."*
>
> *"It didn’t feel like suffering. It felt like a gentle journey into the night.*
> *I was certain I was dying."*
>
> *"Having awakened, I’m no more religious than the day before,*
> *but I feel more spiritual and genuinely grateful for the air that lets me share love.”*

That moment was the most significant spiritual event of my life.

I learned:

- that **consciousness is the last thing that remains**,
- that love is what fills that final awareness, and
- that every breath afterward is **borrowed grace**.

## Here and Now

Fast-forward to the new *“Here and Now!”*

I’m 54. I’m a veteran. I’m rebuilding everything — career, finances, stability, and faith.

And in the middle of that, God reminded me that He had not forgotten my story.

My high school prom date, Cammie, kept every single love letter I wrote her when I left for the Army.

She kept them for **35 years**.

We recently found each other again.

Not a movie. **Real life.**

The theme at our prom was **Luther Vandross’ “Here and Now.”**
That song title became a kind of prophecy I didn’t understand until much later.

Now, *“Here and Now!”* is not just a song — it’s the daily posture:

- gratitude for breath,
- honesty about my failures and scars,
- and faith that nothing in those 35 years was wasted.

## What I’m Doing with This Second Chance

I’ve spent the last months building something called **PortusSophia™** — a simple, serious idea:

- taking suffering and turning it into structure,
- turning structure into hope,
- and turning hope into action.

I’m not “selling religion.”I’m bearing witness to what God has already done:

- I should not be alive after that COVID night.
- I should not have reconnected with someone who kept my letters for 35 years.
- I should not still have the capacity to love, think, build, and serve — but I do.

That’s grace.

## Why There’s a GoFundMe

Right now, I am rebuilding my life from the ground up.

I’m not asking for handouts. I’m asking for:

> **a hand forward.**

The campaign helps me secure:

- a small, safe place to live,
- food and basic essentials,
- and enough stability to complete the work I’ve started and return to steady employment.

If my story resonates with your spirit — if you’ve ever had God pull you back from the edge and hand you a second chance —

then I simply ask:

- Pray for me.
- Share this story if you feel led.
- And if you’re able, support the campaign.

## Faith Isn’t Just Believing — It’s Building

> **Faith isn’t just believing — it’s building.**

And everything worth building begins **Here and Now.**
Often at the moment when we feel least qualified and most broken.

Thank you for reading.
Thank you for caring.

**God is good. Here and Now.**
