# Harmony Story — Then and Now, Here and Now

This is the **human** side of the story — the part about love, memory, and time.

## Then: Prom, Letters, and a Song

As a teenager, I went to prom with a girl named Cammie.

The theme was **Luther Vandross’ “Here and Now.”**

Shortly after, I left for the Army and started writing her letters — real, handwritten letters from a young man who didn’t know what life would throw at him.

What I didn’t know:

- She kept every single one.
- For **35 years**.

Decades passed. Life happened.
Jobs, struggle, distance, silence.

Those letters sat quietly in her care, like a **physical archive of who I once was.**

## COVID: A Thin Line Between Worlds

In 2021, COVID brought me as close to death as I’ve ever been.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t call 911.

I was convinced I was about to leave this world — and yet I felt a strange peace.
Not happiness, not comfort — just the absence of panic and the awareness of the people I loved.

When I somehow woke up and recovered, I wasn’t “more religious” in the traditional sense,but I was more **awake**:

- to breath,
- to time,
- to the people who mattered,
- to how thin the line between *Then and Now* really is.

## Now: 35 Years Later

Some stories don’t resolve quickly.

Decades after that prom night, and long after those letters were written, we reconnected.

She still had the letters.

We are not the same two kids from the 1990s.
We’re older. There are scars, history, and complexity.

But the fact that those letters still exist — that she cared enough to keep them — says something powerful:

> Some threads of love and memory are stronger than time.

That’s what I mean by **Harmony**:

- not perfection,
- not an easy romance arc,
- but the way certain stories circle back and land on the *Here and Now* with a different kind of music.

## The Work I’m Doing Now

I’m 54. I’m rebuilding my life.

I’ve spent months shaping those experiences into **PortusSophia™** — a framework that tries to honor:

- how pain can become structure,
- how structure can become hope,
- and how hope can become action.

I’m trying to live in a way that:

- honors the second chance I’ve been given,
- honors the love and patience shown across decades,
- and honors the people watching me rebuild.

## Why I’m Asking for Help

I’m rebuilding from the ground up:

- finding work,
- securing stable housing,
- maintaining sobriety and discipline,
- finishing the written and structural work of PortusSophia™.

Right now, that requires a **basic, safe boundary**:

- a room,
- food,
- a working connection to the world,
- and a little time to stabilize.

The GoFundMe campaign is not about luxury. It’s about **not losing the orchestra in the middle of the symphony**.

If this story moves you —
if you’ve ever had an old song, an old letter, or an old memory come back and change the way you see your present —

then I invite you:

- Share this story if it might encourage someone else.
- Support the campaign if you’re able and willing.
