## 1. CoSymmetric Quantum-Aligned Architecture (CQAA)
A structural model holding human, technical, and governance layers in stable tension.

## 2. Architectural Symmetry Standard (ASS)

Seven principles describing how meaning emerges between standards and perspectives.

## 4. Multi-Site Ecosystem Architecture
Four-domain topology separating Public, Academic, Governance, and Founder layers.

## 5. Governance Workflow & Witness Structures
Role-separated stewardship, drift detection, and witness cycles.

## 6. WebKernel Directory Architecture
Boundary-enforced documentation layers ensuring clarity and consistency.

## 7. Drift Detection & Boundary Modeling
Tools that help stabilize fragile or overloaded systems by identifying structural failure early.
