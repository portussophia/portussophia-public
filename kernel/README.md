# PortusSophia™ WebKernel — v1.0

The WebKernel is the public interpretive layer of PortusSophia™.

It contains:

- **Interpretive scaffolding** derived from Canon
- **Witness reports** validating structural and ethical integrity
- **Appeals modules** suitable for external audiences
- **Origins modules** suitable for public grounding

This layer is published to [https://www.portussophia.com](https://www.portussophia.com).

**Canonical files never reside here.**

## Directory Structure

```
kernel/
  webkernel/
    interpretive/    # Interpretive triad (v1 DRACO-certified)
    witness/         # Ratio-Fides witness reports
    appeals/         # Public appeals modules
    origins/         # Nullset emergence origins
```

## Boundary Definition

The WebKernel serves as the **publication boundary** between:

- **Canon** (sealed, hash-verified, governance-protected) — remains in private/governance repositories
- **Public Interpretation** (narratively stable, suitable for external consumption) — published here

This ensures:

1. Canonical integrity is never exposed to public drift
2. Public audiences receive coherent, stable interpretive materials
3. The governance boundary remains intact

## Usage

This directory is designed for:

- Static site generation (Jekyll, Hugo, etc.)
- Public website deployment at [portussophia.com](https://www.portussophia.com)
- External documentation and interpretive reference

**Do not modify these files directly.** All updates flow through stewardship governance in the private repository.
