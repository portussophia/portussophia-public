# Public Node Governance & Content Guidelines

**Node:** Public Orientation Layer
**Authority:** Founder (all content changes require approval)
**Stewardship:** PeterGate (governance), Sara Harmonia (tone/language)

## Content Guidelines (Boundary Compliance)

### Allowed Content

- High-level architecture overviews
- Non-technical explanations of principles
- Public announcements and milestones
- Orientation summaries
- Navigation to other nodes (when appropriate)
- FAQ and general information

### Prohibited Content

**Per PS-WEB-TOPOLOGY, this node MUST NOT include:**

- Canon documents (reserved for main site)
- Governance artifacts (witness cycles, integrity seals)
- Internal deliberation records
- Private narrative or personal history
- Academic research details (reserved for MIT node)
- Funding vector or commercial information

**Why:**
This node functions as the **Orientation Layer** only. Mixing layers violates Boundary (𝓑) principle and triggers governance alerts.
