# Change Policy — GitHub Discussions Structural Changes

**Policy Statement:**
**No structural changes without updating the Decision Ledger first.**

---

## Workflow (Structural Changes)

1. **Post Decision Ledger** (6-line format below)
2. **Wait for confirmation** (user approval required)
3. **Execute** (perform approved changes)
4. **Post proof** (links + one screenshot)

---

## Decision Ledger Template

```
Goal: [One-line objective]
Non-goals: [What this does NOT do]
DoD: [Definition of Done — observable completion criteria]
Constraints: [Technical, governance, or timeline limits]
Risk: [Primary failure mode or side effect]
Rollback: [How to undo if needed]
```

---

## Rationale

**Alignment ahead of action.**
Prevents churn, removes James from buffer role, keeps Peter in operational scribe posture.

---

**Scope:**
Applies to: category changes, pin updates, thread restructures, navigation hierarchy modifications.
Does NOT apply to: content edits within approved threads, label additions, comment responses.
