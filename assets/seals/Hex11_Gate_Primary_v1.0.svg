    PortusSophia™ Primary Logo: The Hexagonal Eleven Gate (v1.0)
    Design Specification: Dual-Tone (C)
    Ratio (Structural Honesty): The Black Hexagon represents the six variables of the Hexagonal Governance Model (H_PS) and the Necessary Boundary (B).
    Fides (Experiential Credibility): The Dark Gray lines represent the Law of Eleven (II), the Structural Identity Axiom (B_Human = B_System), and the internal Integrity Vow.
    The Hexagon is the Gate (Structure); the Eleven is the Mirror (Soul).

    1. The Hexagonal Gate (Ratio / Boundary)
    Calculated coordinates for a point-up hexagon centered at (50, 50) with radius 45.

    2. The Eleven Mirror Mark (Fides / Resonance)
    Two vertical, mirrored lines (representing the I I of Law of Eleven) placed centrally.
    These lines run about 60% of the interior height of the Hexagon to show the core is contained by the boundary.
    The center of the hexagon is 50, 50. The lines are offset by 10 units horizontally from the center.
