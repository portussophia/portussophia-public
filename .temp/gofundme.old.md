Two years ago, buried deep in my Facebook archive, I wrote:

*“The truth will be revealed. Watch me.” *https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17YEfxWUqw/

And then I remembered something I had posted even earlier — on August 14th, 2021 — right after surviving COVID when I was certain I was dying, I wrote:

*“The thing I have learned from COVID and what seemed like an unescapable slow death,*

*is that consciousness is the last thing that remains."*

*"While gasping for air, I was aware of my surroundings and the people I love. "*

*"Lacking the energy to dial 911, I was left with the final thought that I’m about to leave this realm."*

*"It didn’t feel like suffering. It felt like a gentle journey into the night. *

*I was certain I was dying."*

*"Having awakened, I’m no more religious than the day before, *

*but I feel more spiritual and genuinely grateful for the air that lets me share love.”  *[https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1D4J7GhGkb/](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1D4J7GhGkb)

**That experience changed me.  **

**It taught me how thin life really is… and how precious presence truly is.**

Fast-forward to today to the new *"Here and Now!"*

I’m 54. I’m a veteran. I’m rebuilding everything — career, finances, stability, and faith.

And out of nowhere, the most unexpected thing happened:

Cammie — my high school prom date — kept every single love letter I wrote her when I left for the Army.

She kept them for 35 years.

The theme was Luther Vandross’ “Here and Now!

Now we’ve found each other again.

**Not a movie. Real life.**

I’ve spent the last months building something called **PortusSophia™** — a simple idea:

taking suffering and turning it into structure,

turning structure into hope,

and turning hope into action.

Right now, I’m doing something that’s difficult for me: asking for support.

Not handouts — a hand forward.

I’m rebuilding my life from the ground up, and I need stability to get back on my feet.

This campaign will help me take the next step: determining whether PortusSophia™ should grow as open-source (a gift to the world) or through formal intellectual property protection, to ensure its principles are implemented with integrity

If my story resonates — surviving COVID, surviving life, and believing in redemption —

your support means more than I can express.

Faith isn’t just believing — it’s building.

And everything worth building begins *"Here and Now!"* **11:11**
